# Diego Faria

Hi there, I'm Diego Faria.<a href="https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>

You are in my github page. So I believe that you are interested to know something about me.
Here I try to describe a little bit about my life, studies and goals.

**Feel free to send me feedbacks about this page and all of my projects on Github. I will be grateful to receive your point of view and/or suggestions.**

### About my career :construction_worker: 
At this moment I am working in [Cielo](https://www.cielo.com.br/) as Operation Analyst on Marketplaces. So I understand about E-commerces, Split Payments, Installments, and Point Of Sales.

Before it I worked with NOCs in big Companies like [Stone](https://www.stone.com.br), [Estacio College](https://estacio.br) and [Grupo Águas do Brasil](https://www.grupoaguasdobrasil.com.br).

During my experience in NOCs I discovered my passion about programming languages. I started writing some monitoring scripts and autommations using **Python** and now I love to write complex SQL queries for reports, create console applications and small APIs to solve operations problems.

And now, I'm looking for a migration on my career to be a developer

### About my studies :computer: 
I’m learning C#, ASP.NET and Dart Flutter.
Why two languages? Because I love backend. But sometimes we need a screen to see some value in our projects. So in a future I can be a Fullstack mobile, or maybe Fullstack web using Flutter web.


English... It's my  weakness. I can study and understand [Assembly Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), but I can't understand English :laughing:.
I'm Brazilian, but I'm living in Canada, so I need to do my best :muscle:. So let's talk and help me to improve. I accept tips.:pray:
